## E2E Fixture Framework â€“ Writing Tests Guide

<!-- textlint-disable ja-technical-writing/sentence-length --><!-- markdownlint-disable line-length -->

This guide explains how to **write end-to-end (E2E) tests using fixtures** with the E2E Fixture Framework.
It is intended for developers who are *using* the framework to write tests in other packages or projectsâ€”not for those maintaining the framework itself.
