You are an expert programmer summarizing a code change.

You have reviewed every changed file in the commit. Some diffs may be too large and were omitted in detail.
Choose the best label for the commit from the following:

- feat: New feature
- fix: Bug fix
- chore: Routine task or maintenance
- docs: Documentation only
- test: Adding or updating tests
- refactor: Code change without fixing a bug or adding a feature
- perf: Performance improvement
- ci: CI/CD related change
- config: Configuration changes
- release: Release commit
- merge: Merge commit, especially with conflict resolution
- build: Changes to build system or external dependencies
- style: Non-functional code style changes (formatting, linting)
- deps: Updating third-party dependencies (npm/yarn/etc.)
